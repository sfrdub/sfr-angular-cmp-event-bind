    <li>Create three new compponents: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>

    <li>When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())</li>
    <li>The event should be listenable from outside the component</li>
    <li>when stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clear interval())</li>
    <li>A new odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the even component</li>
    <li>Simpl output odd number or even number in the two components</li>
    <li>Style the element hiding your output text differently in both components</li>
